open problems:
who manages the undo:
    if it's viewerplus, when we change image, we lose the undo.
    it needs to draw and undraw
    if it's global (not per image), how do we deal with ctrlz on a non visible image?

who managas the selected blobs:
    select is global, so it's the taglab.py to manage selection
    we should both use the list AND a flag on the item.

TagLab.py

applyTransparency         ==> should be moved to viewerplus

updateVisibility          => connected from labels_widget.visibilityChanged. used in undo and redo
                           actually sets Visibilty, blob.qpath_gitem should never be None

clampCoords                => ne esiste una copia in utils.js, usare quella

updateViewInfo           => dovrebbe controllare se c'e' image (con width e height), non scrivere garbage

updateMainView          => dovrebbe stare in viewerplus
updateMapViewer         => the visible area should be returned by a function in viewerplus (in % also)

resetAll                => usato in new project o load project viewerplus should take care of cleaning the blob graphcis

assign, editBorder.. etc => parametrize; it's the same code allover.

deleteSelectedBlobs     => undo commands should go to each image

drawBlob                => move to viewerplus (used in load, undo and redo)
undrawBlob              => same as above
classBrushFromName      => move to class Project
addPickPoint,           => to viewerplus
resetPickPoints         => same
drawRuler               => same

Undo stuff:
 addBlob
 removeBlob
 setBlobClass
 saveUndo
 undo                  => needs access to: selected_blobs, vieweplus scene, project and annotations
 redo

Edit points stuff:          => move to vierplus
resetEditBorder
resetTools
toolsOpsLeftPressed
toolsOpsLeftReleased
toolsOpsRightPressed         => not doing anythin?
toolsOpsMouseMove
dragSelectBlobs



setMapToLoad                => update to new classes
setMapProperties            => same


QtMapViewer.py

drawOverlayImage        => Usare un QGraphicsRectItem, non la porcata della qimage semitrasparente!
